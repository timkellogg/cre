This is a Sinatra-based web application that allows users to search for political information regarding congressional records, campaign finance, legislative representatives, and more.  It uses the Sunlight Foundation API to access data.

It is currently being developed.

Goals:

- Refactor & Seperate app.rb into Controllers 
- Add asset pipeline to compile and minify css & js code 
- Refactor CSS into SASS
